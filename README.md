# Employee Turnover Prediction  
Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project  
NTU KM6312 – Group 8

This project aims to predict employee turnover using the Kaggle HR Analytics dataset (14,999 samples).  
We implemented and compared **traditional machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM) and a **deep learning model (MLP)**.  
The study includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and business insights.
